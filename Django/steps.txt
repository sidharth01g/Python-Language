0. Set up virtualenv for python3

$ sudo apt-get install python3-pip
$ # Prefix the next command with sudo if it gives a permission denied error
$ pip3 install virtualenv
$ virtualenv --python=`which python3` ~/.virtualenvs/djangodev
$ source ~/.virtualenvs/djangodev/bin/activate
If the source command is not available, you can try using a dot instead:

$ . ~/.virtualenvs/djangodev/bin/activate



1. Create a project

    django-admin startproject mysite

sidharth@sidharth-550P5C-550P7C:~/Dropbox/Academic/Concepts/Django$ find .

5. Set up DB
$ python manage.py migrate

6. Create application
$ python manage.py startapp polls


7. Migrations are very powerful and let you change your models over time, as you develop your project, without the need to delete your database or tables and make new ones - it specializes in upgrading your database live, without losing data. Weâ€™ll cover them in more depth in a later part of the tutorial, but for now, remember the three-step guide to making model changes:

Change your models (in models.py).
Run python manage.py makemigrations to create migrations for those changes
Run python manage.py migrate to apply those changes to the database.
